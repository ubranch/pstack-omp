# Poteto help

Answer the user's question about pstack, hand them a prompt they can send, and link the file the answer came from. For a help question, don't start the work. The user asked how, and a pstack run spends real tokens, so let them send the prompt.

A message that asks for work, such as "use pstack to fix this bug", is not a help question. Read [`poteto-mode`](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md), do the work under it, and mention once that `/poteto-mode on` keeps it on for the session.

This file maps questions to the skills and guide pages that hold the answers. Those files own the details. Read the file you route to before you quote it, and trust it when it disagrees with this map. The links here point into the installed plugin, which the user may not be able to open, so give the user the file's public copy: `https://github.com/ubranch/pstack-omp/blob/main/plugins/pstack/` followed by its path.

On OMP, type every skill command below except `/poteto-mode` as `/skill:<name>`, for example `/skill:ketchup`. A bare `/ketchup` is sent as plain text.

## Find out what they need

Infer the need from the message and the conversation. A named situation, such as "which skill reviews a PR?", goes straight to its section. If the need is still unclear, ask one multiple-choice question with these options, then answer only the section they pick:

- Get set up
- Start a task with `/poteto-mode`
- Pick a skill for a situation
- Fix a run that went wrong
- Make pstack my own

Check the state that changes the answer, and mention it only when it does:

- Existing OMP `modelRoles` and `task.agentModelOverrides` may already configure delegation. Inspect the active configuration through [`/setup-pstack`](../setup-pstack/SKILL.md); a missing Cursor rule file says nothing about OMP setup.
- No `verify-*` skill or other app harness in the project means agents have no scripted way to drive the app. Mention `/create-verification-skill` when the question is about proving a change works.
- No formal verification skill in the project means no property is checked past what tests reach. Mention `/create-formal-verification-skill` when the question is about a race, an invariant, or another case tests rarely hit. When one exists and the code it covers changed after the commit it records as last in sync, mention `/maintain-formal-verification-skill` if the question touches that code.

When setup or cost matters, offer the optional [`/setup-pstack`](../setup-pstack/SKILL.md) audit once. It preserves valid current choices and asks only about unresolved role choices. Do not infer an unconfigured runtime from a missing role override.

- Now: give them `/setup-pstack` to type, and answer their question too.
- Later: answer their question using the active runtime configuration, and report any unavailable model metadata.

## Get set up

1. Install the OMP fork through the plugin workflow documented in the [README](../../README.md).
2. Optionally run [`/setup-pstack`](../setup-pstack/SKILL.md) to inspect existing OMP role settings and resolve missing choices. It does not reset valid models or approval policy. It offers a verification skill or a formal verification skill only when you ask how to prove changes.
3. Start a real task with `/poteto-mode`, a goal, and a check that can pass or fail.

Installing registers the skills and bundled agents; workflow execution still starts with invocation. The [README](../../README.md) and [OMP setup reference](../omp-mechanics/references/setup-pstack-config.md) hold the runtime details. Offer to word their first prompt with them, per [`references/prompting.md`](references/prompting.md).

If cost is the worry, explain that independent workers and review contexts spend tokens. Use the existing model configuration and keep rigor proportional to the task. The optional setup audit can explain valid cheaper choices. Do not derive a panel size from a model list or silently lower a required verification bar.

This is the OMP port of pstack. [`pstack-omp`](../pstack-omp/SKILL.md) maps the methodology to the live task surface, and [`omp-mechanics`](../omp-mechanics/SKILL.md) owns platform amendments. Report capabilities from the live tools, not from a plugin version or another runtime.

## Start a task with `/poteto-mode`

`/poteto-mode` matches the task to a playbook, copies the playbook's steps into the todo list, and runs the other skills as the steps need them. A step it skips stays in the list as `skip: <reason>`. A good prompt states the goal and how to tell it's done. It doesn't list skills, because a hand-written sequence tends to drop or reorder steps the playbook would keep. Read [`references/prompting.md`](references/prompting.md) before you help word one. [Guide page 2](../../README.md) has examples.

Whether `/poteto-mode` stays on depends on how the user starts it:

- Invoking `/poteto-mode` loads the playbook router. Start each new task with it when the runtime does not keep it active.
- A native persistent mode may keep it active when the runtime supports that feature. Use only the live UI or command documented by OMP; do not assume Cursor shortcuts.
- The [README](../../README.md) describes the port's mode reminder and invocation.

Link the [README](../../README.md) and [`pstack-omp`](../pstack-omp/SKILL.md) for invocation and delegation. Mid-chat, "new task" makes the mode match a fresh playbook. For an independent delegate in this style, resolve the optional `poteto-agent` target through the live adapter; do not invent task fields.

## Pick a skill

The default answer is `/poteto-mode`, which runs most of the others when its steps need them. Name a skill directly when the user wants more or less of something than the playbook gives. Read the skill before you recommend it, and give one example prompt.

| The user wants to | Skill |
|---|---|
| Do any non-trivial task with rigor | [`/poteto-mode`](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md) |
| Check that the agent understood their goal and the problem before it starts | [`/in-your-own-words`](../in-your-own-words/SKILL.md) |
| Get a prompt rewritten deeper, not bigger, before sending it: what a top professional would add, their raw material and methods, and an outside check. It returns the prompt and doesn't do the task | [`/sharpen`](../sharpen/SKILL.md) |
| Know how code works now, or where new code should live | [`/how`](../how/SKILL.md) |

| Run parallel checks over slices, or race workers, in separate worktrees | [`/swarm`](../swarm/SKILL.md) |
| Have different models review a diff and try to break it | [`/interrogate`](../interrogate/SKILL.md) |
| Fix a bug test-first when a cheap local test exists | [`/tdd`](../tdd/SKILL.md) |

| Bring a formal verification back in line after the code it covers changed, and learn whether a failure is drift or a bug | [`/maintain-formal-verification-skill`](../maintain-formal-verification-skill/SKILL.md) |
| Show a PM or designer what the user sees as a chart checked by a model, with each bug drawn as a numbered path, turn an agreed chart into a TLA+ skeleton, or audit the code against its TLA+ spec | [`/statechart`](../statechart/SKILL.md) |
| Vet a performance number before reporting or acting on it | [`/benchmark-checklist`](../benchmark-checklist/SKILL.md) |
| Run a large or cross-cutting change, or one to review after stepping away | [`/figure-it-out`](../figure-it-out/SKILL.md) |

| Find their way around pstack | `/poteto-help` |

If a skill directory next to this one is missing from the table, read its frontmatter and route by its description. The `principle-*` directories are covered under principles below.

Close calls:

- `/how` explains what the code does. `/why` explains the reasons. `/teach` runs one or both and explains the result plainly.
- `/arena` gives every worker the same brief and merges the best parts. `/swarm` splits work into slices or a race and returns one report.
- `/architect` implements right after it settles the design. Add "with checkpoint" to review the design before it writes code.
- `/interrogate` reviews the diff. `/blast-radius` looks for breakage outside the diff and proves the one fact that makes the change safe.
- `/recall` rebuilds context across recent chats. `/ketchup` covers only this chat since the user's last message. Resuming one specific chat or branch is the Session pickup playbook.
- `/figure-it-out` designs one rigorous run. The Orchestrate playbook runs a program that spans days and many PRs. The Autonomous run playbook drives one task to a finish condition.

Not in pstack:

- Prose cleanup uses the bundled `unslop` skill. Runtime verification uses the live browser or desktop controls, bash, or PTY as the surface demands.
- `/loop` is optional native runtime behavior, not a bundled pstack skill. Authoring uses the authoring-a-skill playbook and the live file tools.
- pstack has no `/orchestrate` skill. Orchestrate is a `/poteto-mode` playbook. If the slash menu shows `/orchestrate`, another plugin provides it.

## Playbooks and principles

Playbooks are step lists inside `/poteto-mode`, not skills, so they have no slash command. Inside `/poteto-mode`, describing the task picks one, and these phrases name one directly:

- "babysit this pr" or "check on pr 123" runs Babysit. It drives the PR to merge-ready and stops there. It doesn't merge unless the user asks to merge, land, or ship.
- "land the stack" runs Shipping.
- "take over this branch" runs Session pickup.
- "pause safely" runs Pause safely.
- "full autopilot on this queue" runs Autopilot-full. "stack them, don't ship" runs Autopilot-stack.
- "run the eval playbook" runs Eval.

Without `/poteto-mode`, another installed skill may claim a similar request. The Playbooks section of [`poteto-mode`](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md) lists the authoritative pstack workflows. The [README](../../README.md) covers opening, babysitting, and landing a PR.

pstack has no separate planning skill. A native runtime plan mode is optional. For phases or stacked PRs, asking `/poteto-mode` for a plan runs the [Multi-phase plan playbook](../poteto-mode/playbooks/multi-phase-plan.md), which writes the plan and does not implement it. For a design question, the Prototype playbook or `/architect` settles it in code first.

Principles are one-rule skills that `/poteto-mode` reads and cites in its replies. The user rarely invokes one. They steer with the names instead, as in "apply prove it works. show me the real output." Typing `/skill:principle-<name>` still loads one on demand. The Principles section of [`poteto-mode`](../poteto-mode/SKILL.md) lists them.

## Fix a run that went wrong

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| The mode stopped applying after a few turns | Pin it with `/poteto-mode on` (it persists in the saved chat), or start each task with `/poteto-mode`. |
| A question got treated as the next step of the last task | Say "new task", or say the turn doesn't need the mode. |
| A new model choice had no effect | Inspect the effective OMP role configuration and returned model metadata with `/setup-pstack`; follow only the native reload behavior actually required. |
| Runs cost more than expected | See the cost paragraph under Get set up. |
| A skill did not load on its own | Invoke it explicitly or let `/poteto-mode` route to it. Invocation metadata differs between runtimes; see the adapter. |
| Parallel agents overwrote each other | Create separate worktrees before dispatch or give workers disjoint writable paths. A task call does not allocate a private machine. |
| An overnight run moved but finished nothing | Use a checkable predicate and the root-owned wake mechanism in the Autonomous run playbook. A duration or background job alone does not prove completion. |
| The reply claims success from a green build | Ask for the real command, flow, stored value, or profile. That's the prove-it-works principle. |

For a run that drifts, [`references/prompting.md`](references/prompting.md) has one-line steers. [Guide page 10](../../README.md) has more pitfalls and the recipes worth copying.

## Make pstack my own

- [`/automate-me`](../automate-me/SKILL.md) drafts a personal mode skill from the user's own history, to use alongside `/poteto-mode`.
- [`/reflect`](../reflect/SKILL.md) after a session turns its lessons into skill edits the user approves.
- `/poteto-mode write a skill for <workflow>` runs the authoring playbook. The eval playbook tests a skill change blind.
- Fix a misbehaving skill in its own PR, not inside the feature work where it went wrong.

[Guide page 9](../../README.md) covers each of these.

## Reply

Lead with the answer. Give at most one example prompt in a code block, adapted from [`references/recipes.md`](references/recipes.md) when one fits, then the link to that file. Keep it short unless the user asked for the whole map.
