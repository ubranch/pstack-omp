### Orchestrate

Read `skill://pstack-omp` for dispatch and lifecycle. The root starts participants, accepts evidence, and performs authorized external writes and merges after the applicable operator, CI, and independent-review gates. A bounded worker prepares local branch/diff/head evidence and returns dispatch and PR-action requests instead of starting children or publishing. Use explicit private worktrees when writers overlap. Keep the operator's model configuration and approval policy unchanged.

**You run the program, never the code. Decide which agent does each piece of work, then check what each one produces.** For a standing project handed to one coordinator chat: multi-day, many stacked PRs, dozens to hundreds of subagents, few human turns. One task driven to a predicate is Autonomous run. One ambitious run that needs a bespoke workflow is figure-it-out. Work that one agent could finish inside the session's budget is not a program.

Run it with your own tools. Start workers through `skill://pstack-omp`. Keep the program's state in the Project tracker (`notes.md`) and the Project store. Check PR and CI state through the forge when you need it. Call no scripts, run no polling loops, and never relay messages or status between agents. Read returned results through `agent://<id>` and message a live agent with `write agent://<id>`.

#### Topology

- **One owner per PR.** The owner is the only local writer of its branch, in its own private worktree, and carries the PR from build to merge-ready. It returns exact heads and PR-action requests; the root performs every push, rebase publication, retarget, and merge after the existing gates. Closing or retargeting a base PR orphans every PR above it, so the root does that only on your call. You never author or edit code. Conflicted merges, chain rebases, and fixes go to owners.
- **A fresh worker for each independent task.** Its kickoff carries everything it needs, including each upstream report it depends on, pasted in full. Workers can't see their siblings. Each worker runs locally with a standalone brief and an explicit worktree path; runtime checks use the live browser controls or bash and PTY as the authorized assignment demands. Keep each subagent's configured model and effort, per the Subagents section.
- **A track owner only when one area has many parallel workers.** It authors that area's kickoffs and returns dispatch requests to the root, because ordinary workers do not start children, publish, or merge. It sends you one rollup, never raw worker reports. Stop at three levels: you, track owners, and workers. Keep about ten workers in flight per coordinator, and start the next one as each finishes instead of waiting on a whole batch.
- **Reuse a live worker when new work needs its built state,** such as its checkout, uncommitted changes, or a running process. Message a worker only for a follow-up on the same work. Never message one to check on it, because a message restarts an idle agent.
- **Each PR gets a verifier that isn't its author,** on a different model family. The root merges only on that verifier's pass at the current head.
- **Start with one unit.** Take it through kickoff, owner, verifier, and merge before you fan out, so a flaw in the kickoff costs one agent instead of fifty. On near-identical cheap units, the first unit is that test.

#### Supervision

- **Each kickoff names the evidence that proves the work is done,** such as a command and its expected output, a control-skill check, or an artifact. It also names the goal, the paths the worker may and may not write, and the actions it must not take. If you can't name the evidence, the unit isn't scoped yet.
- **Read the diff or the artifact, not only the worker's summary.** Green CI is an input to a verdict, not a verdict. Behavioral work needs more than a type check. A verdict covers one head SHA, so a new head needs a new verdict. Read a sample of each track owner's kickoffs while its workers run, and fix its instructions when one fails.
- **Send back work that drifts from scope or grows past what was asked.** Keep only the fixes that block the program, and park the rest as follow-ups.
- **Check a PR's live state before you report on it,** with `gh pr view` and `gh pr checks` or your forge's equivalents, not the worker's last report. Account for every worker you spawned as done, replaced, or absorbed into another worker's scope.
- **Stop or replace a worker that stalls or loops.** Judge it by its returned heads, worktree changes, and PR activity, not its status text. Retry by cause: a smaller scope after a context or memory limit, the same kickoff after a dropped connection, and a different model after a tool error. After two retries, drop the unit and replan around it. When a stopped worker returns late, check its result against the PR's current state, and hand any unique findings to a fresh worker.
- **Ask the user only for a real decision or a blocker,** such as an irreversible action, a product or preference call that no experiment settles, or a dead end that survived a replan. Rebase mechanics, retries, CI flakes, review triage, and "should I keep going" never reach the user.

**Reply:** what landed against the goal, each PR's live state and verdict with its link, what was dropped and why, and the decisions waiting on the user.
